### 🌐 About Me
I’m a dedicated **Network Engineer** passionate about enterprise-level routing, switching, and network design.  
I enjoy creating complex topologies, optimizing routing protocols, and ensuring network reliability.
I believe in continuous learning — I’ve completed my **CCNA**, I’m pursuing **CCNP Switching & Routing**,  
and I plan to advance toward **CCIE Enterprise Infrastructure** certification.
